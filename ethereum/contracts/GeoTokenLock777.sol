/**
 * @dev Contract to hold and release in steps the funds of GEO for the presale investors. ERC777 Implementation
 *
 * This contract will be passed a BENEFICIARY (ADDRESS) and a lock DURATION IN DAYS. The constructor will compute
 * the timestamp at which the funds should be released. Then the beneficiary or the owner can call the unlock function
 * to release an amount of tokens proportional to the time that has passed since the lock, eg: if a lock of 180 days
 * has been passed to the constructor, and 10 (10e18) tokens have been assigned, then the user will be able to
 * withdraw 5 (5e18) tokens approximately. It is important that the amount of tokens being held is divisible by
 * the duration of the lock in seconds, otherwise the amount will be fully locked until the complete time has passed,
 * missing the stepped release (ie, if lock duration is 180 days = 15 552 000 seconds, and less than 15 552 000 tokens
 * are locked, then the division yields 0 tokens per step, and won't be able to unlock the tokens until 15 552 000
 * seconds have passed).
 *
 * The contract takes advantage of the ERC777 specification in a way that it is not possible to lose tokens.
 * Sending tokens to the contract will update the locked amount for the beneficiary to withdraw, but it will not
 * update the timestamp for the full unlock.
