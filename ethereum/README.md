# TODOs:

- [] Testing for staking change
- [] Refactor of smart contract: ballots unification, gas cost optimization
- [] Implement justice voting
- [] Implement block summary upload
- [] Implement testing with truffle suite and openzeppelin-test-helpers. This includes implementing best practices for contract testing (e.g. using beforeEach to reset the contract and test complete workflows)
- [] Implement contract events and their testing
